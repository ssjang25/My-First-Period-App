# "My First Period"

"My First Period" is an educational iOS app-game that aims to destigmatize menstruation and teach young girls about menstruation through a series of mini-tasks. Accompanied with its cute pixel-style UI and simple instructions, it's a great way to expose those who aren't ready for the whirlwinds brought along with menstruation.

## Origins

Constructed on a whim, this game was created in the span of 24 hours at Hack(h)er413 2023. Go UMass!

## Code Details

The app was made using React Native and Expo Go as the main way to test features on iOS devices in real-time. It includes custom-created pixel-art inspired sprites as the buttons and the main character whose period journey begins. From React Native, various components like navigators, touchable opacity components, and alerts are used to create smooth transitions from and to various screens.
